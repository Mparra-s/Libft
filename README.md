# 📚 Libft
## Description

Libft is a custom implementation of a set of standard C library functions, developed as part of the 42 curriculum.
The goal of this project is to gain a deep understanding of how basic C functions work internally, while building a reusable library that can be used in future projects.

All functions are written in C and follow the constraints and norms defined by 42.

<br/>

## Project Objectives

  - Reimplement standard C library functions from <ctype.h>, <string.h>, <stdlib.h>, and <unistd.h>

  - Understand memory management and pointer manipulation

  - Build a static library (libft.a)

  - Learn how to design clean, reusable, and well-structured code

<br/>



## Norms and Constraints

  - Written in C

  - Compliant with the 42 Norm

  - No forbidden functions

  - No memory leaks

<br/>

## Library Structure

The library is divided into several parts:

  - Part 1 – Libc Functions

    Reimplementations of common libc functions, such as:

    - ft_strlen

    - ft_memset

    - ft_bzero

    - ft_memcpy

    - ft_strlcpy

    - ft_strlcat

    - ft_strncmp

    - ft_atoi

    - ft_isalpha, ft_isdigit, ft_isalnum, ft_isascii, ft_isprint

    - ft_toupper, ft_tolower

  <br/>


  - Part 2 – Additional Functions

    Utility functions not present in libc but useful for later projects:

    - ft_substr

    - ft_strjoin

    - ft_strtrim

    - ft_split

    - ft_itoa

    - ft_strmapi

    - ft_striteri

    - ft_putchar_fd

    - ft_putstr_fd

    - ft_putendl_fd

    - ft_putnbr_fd
   
  <br/>

  - Bonus Part – Linked Lists

    Functions to manipulate singly linked lists using the following structure:
    Bonus functions include:

    - ft_lstnew

    - ft_lstadd_front

    - ft_lstadd_back

    - ft_lstsize

    - ft_lstlast

    - ft_lstdelone

    - ft_lstclear

    - ft_lstiter

    - ft_lstmap
